As of now, the game only has a roulette wheel with a spinning functionalty and a betting system for color and odd/even.

        description: "This is the largest project I have built completely from scratch using React. This project has a lot of features including the ability to pin, edit, delete, and categorize notes. The most notable feature of this application is that it can save notes locally even if the user exits the application. Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks are heavily used in this application as they are needed to account for and to track which notes are being modified. In addition, this app is fully repsonsive, meaning that it is optimized to be used on all different platforms (computers and mobile devices of all screen sizes).",

The user is also able to backtrack to the previous joke. React's useState hook is used to store the generated jokes to allow backtracking while the useEffect hook is used to save the jokes in storage for when the user reloads and/or returns back to the app later.",

This project is derived from Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp, but I added new features to it and improved its aesthetics (with Bulma, a CSS framework). The first feature is a reset button, which resets the search input and clears all displayed cover arts. The second feature clears all displayed cover arts when the user enters a new search and clicks on the search button.",
